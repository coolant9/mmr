Micro Media Rederer.

Extremely light weight implementation of upnp's media renderer profile.
Built for extremely lean hardware, like a linux based router with 32MB RAM.


It implements the AVTransport, Connection_manager and rendering_control services.
The actual play happens through an instance of mpd.
The configuration exists in mmr.conf
